=====================================================

Simple single lathcing power relay PCB. 

Suitable for Particle Photon or Electron.


Features:
---------
* 250V AC, 24V DC 16A Relay (Don't use full current with the PCB as the tracks are not up to that!)
* Latching relay. Does not require power to stay in desired state.
* 3V DC relay, can be powered when Photon or Electron are on battery power.
* USB power in via A Connector on left edge, USB B Connector on Photon/Electron. (Do not connect both at once).
* 3 Mounting holes to allow board to be mounted in case for final use.
